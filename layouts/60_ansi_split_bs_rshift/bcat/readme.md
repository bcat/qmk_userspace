# bcat's 60% ANSI layout with split Backspace and Right Shift

This is a hybrid of a Tsangan/HHKB layout and a standard ANSI bottom row. It's
not my favorite layout, but it's nice enough if you only have a 6.25u spacebar.
Other than the bottom row, this is identical to my regular [Tsangan
layout](/layouts/60_tsangan_hhkb/bcat).
