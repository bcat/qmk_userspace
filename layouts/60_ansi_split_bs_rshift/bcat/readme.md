# bcat's 60% ANSI layout with split Backspace and Right Shift

This layout features an HHKB-style split Backspace and Right Shift together with
a standard ANSI bottom row. It's not my favorite layout, but can be useful when
used with a keycap set that only includes a 6.25u spacebar. This keymap is
configured identically to my preferred [Tsangan
layout](/layouts/60_tsangan_hhkb/bcat), with the additional bottom row position
mapped to the Menu key.
