# bcat's 60% ANSI Tsangan HHKB layout

This is a Tsangan/HHKB (split backspace, split right shift) layout following the
[traditional HHKB layout](https://deskthority.net/wiki/HHKB_Professional2) with
a few changes:

* The Delete key is mapped as Backspace (HHKB DIP switch 3).

* The Alt and Super keys are swapped to put Alt directly adjacent to the
  spacebar (HHKB DIP switch 5).

* The left Super key is replaced with another Fn key (HHKB DIP switch 2). Unlike
  on the real HHKB, this key triggers a different Fn2 layer. (This also helps
  prevent accidental Super key presses while gaming.)

* The Fn2 layer contains reset keys, RGB underglow and backlight controls (in
  place of the arrow and navigation keys), and media controls (centered around
  the ESDF cluster).

* The Fn2 layer also has the F1-F12 keys mapped just like the Fn layer. This is
  a concession to gaming because it enables these keys to be easily typed with
  the left hand, without taking the right hand off the mouse.

* The leftmost and rightmost bottom row keys are mapped to Ctrl rather than
  anything more useful because most of my Tsangan PCBs actually have HHKB plates
  and/or blockers, so there aren't switches installed in those positions.
