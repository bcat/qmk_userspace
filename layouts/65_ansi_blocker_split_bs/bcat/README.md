# bcat's 65% ANSI (blocker and split Backspace) layout

This is a standard 65% keyboard layout, with a blocker to the left of the arrow
keys and an HHKB-style (split) Backspace.

<summary>Layout notes</summary>

* Based on [60% Tsangan](/layouts/60_ansi_tsangan_split_bs_rshift/bcat) layout.
  See that page for detailed rationale on keymap design.
* The bottom row is laid out more like a traditional TKL keyboard, with the
  Super key on the left and a single Fn key on the right.
* Dedicated arrow and navigation keys replace the HHKB diamond cluster (which
  I've since grown to prefer).
