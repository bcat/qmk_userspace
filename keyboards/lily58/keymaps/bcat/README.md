# bcat's Lily58 layout

This split ergo keyboard features 4x6 columnar-staggered keys and 4 thumb keys
per side.

<summary>Layout notes</summary>

* Based on [split 3x6+3](/layouts/split_3x6_3/bcat) layout. See that page for
  detailed rationale on keymap design.
* There's an optional number row at the top of the keyboard. I am quite used to
  using layers for numbers and symbols, so in practice this goes unused.
* The dedicated Hyphen/Underscore and Equals/Plus keys on the number row are
  placed in the same positions as on the ErgoDox EZ. (There's no real reason for
  this; I just had to do _something_ with those keys.)
* The extra bottom row keys are mapped to Alt and Super for convenience, just as
  they are on my [Altair-X](/keyboards/ai03/altair_x/bcat).
* The additional keys below the controllers are bound to browser zoom keys.
